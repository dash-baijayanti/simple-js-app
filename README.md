#simple-js-app ,the basic knowledge of JavaScript.
This project is a web-based Pokedex application that fetches data from the PokeAPI. It displays a list of Pokemon color-code by type with their images, and allows users to view more details about each Pokemon in a modal.
Technologies and Dependencies
This project is built using a variety of modern web development technologies and dependencies to ensure a high-quality, user-friendly application.

JavaScript ES6
The core functionality of the application is written in JavaScript ES6. This includes the use of promises for asynchronous operations, arrow functions for cleaner syntax, and modules for better code organization.

jQuery
jQuery is used to simplify the DOM manipulation and event handling. It provides a powerful, easy-to-use API for interacting with HTML documents.

Bootstrap
Bootstrap is used for the application's responsive layout, pre-designed components, and modal dialogs. It ensures that the application looks good on all screen sizes, provides a consistent user experience, and allows for interactive modal dialogs to display detailed information about each Pokemon.

PokeAPI
The PokeAPI is used to fetch the data about the Pokemon. It is a RESTful API that provides data about all known Pokemon, including their names, types, abilities, and images.

Prettier and ESLint
Prettier is used to automatically format the code to ensure it follows a consistent style. ESLint is used to catch potential bugs and enforce best practices. Together, they help maintain the quality and readability of the code.

Other Dependencies
Other dependencies include the Fetch API for making HTTP requests, and the Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) pattern for encapsulating the Pokemon repository.
